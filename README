A Simple OpenCL C++ Template 
    N.Nakasato (nakasato@u-aizu.ac.jp)

1. build
   type make

To build this code, you need "cl.hpp" header file.
It is available at http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/
I have tested the code with OpenCL 1.1.

2. run
   ./run 0 0

The first argument select a platform (AMD SDK, Intel SDK or NVIDIA SDK....).
The second argument select a device (CPU or GPU, or any exotic device).


Note for MacOS X
Please directly include "cl.hpp" after downloading.
And you need a linker option such as "-framework OpenCL" not "-lOpenCL".
